<h1>99 Bottles</h1


<div>
<p>Using a for loop, print the lyrics to the song 99 bottles of milk (beer).<br>
 If you don’t know the words, you can find them 
 <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html">here</a><br> 
 <br>
 Don't forget that the last verses are different....<br>
 <br>
 1 bottle of milk on the wall, 1 bottle of milk.<br>
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall.<br>
<br>
No more bottles of milk on the wall, no more bottles of milk. <br>
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of milk on the wall.<br>
<br>
To make it harder, don’t repeat ANY lyrics in your code.</p>
