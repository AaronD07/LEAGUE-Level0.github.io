<h1>Pi Day</h1>



 <p class="normal">
	1. Create a class called PiDay and give it a main method. Check that program can run.<br>
</p>
 <p class="normal">
	2. Make a String variable called pi to hold some of the digits of Pi.<br>
	 If you don't know Pi, go to  http://www.piday.org/million/ to get as many digits as you like.<br>
	 Just make sure you have at least 10!<br>
</p>
	<p class="normal">
  3. Print out 4 of the digits of your string.<br>
	HINT: The first value is pi.charAt(0), the second is pi.charAt(1)......<br>
	Run your code and you should see 3.14 in the Console.<br>
</p>
	<p class="normal">
	4. Ask the user what the next digit of Pi is.<br>
	If they get it right, congratulate them <br>
	If they get it wrong, tell them "NO PIE FOR YOU!" and end the program   HINT:  System.exit(0);<br>
	</p>
	<p class="normal">
	5. keep asking them for each new digit until the make a mistake or you run out of digits in your String<br>
